# Payoova 2.0 - Issues Fixed & Improvements Made

## üéØ Issues Addressed

### 1. ‚úÖ Wallet Auto-Generation on Signup
**Problem**: Wallets were not automatically generated when users signed up.

**Solution**:
- Modified `backend/src/routes/auth.py` to auto-generate wallets for Ethereum, Polygon, and BSC networks when new users are created
- Added auto-generation logic in `WalletContext.jsx` as a fallback for existing users
- Wallets are now created automatically 2 seconds after user login if none exist

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/src/routes/auth.py`
- `src/contexts/WalletContext.jsx`

### 2. ‚úÖ Cards Section - Virtual Card Status
**Problem**: Virtual card showed as "active" but should show "Coming Soon".

**Solution**:
- Changed virtual card status from 'active' to 'coming_soon'
- Updated card descriptions to indicate both virtual and physical cards are coming soon
- Simplified UI to show consistent "Coming Soon" messaging
- Removed unused imports and variables

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/cards/Cards.jsx`

### 3. ‚úÖ Transaction History Errors
**Problem**: Transaction history component had missing methods and poor error handling.

**Solution**:
- Added `loadTransactions` method to `WalletContext.jsx`
- Implemented proper error handling and loading states
- Added support for filtering transactions by network, status, and type
- Fixed pagination and data fetching logic

**Files Modified**:
- `src/contexts/WalletContext.jsx`
- `src/components/wallet/TransactionHistory.jsx`

### 4. ‚úÖ Send/Receive Button Errors
**Problem**: Send and receive components had missing context methods and poor error handling.

**Solution**:
- Added missing helper methods (`getBalanceByNetwork`, `getPriceBySymbol`) to `WalletContext.jsx`
- Improved gas fee estimation with real API calls and fallback to mock data
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback
- Added wallet generation option in receive component for missing wallets

**Files Modified**:
- `src/contexts/WalletContext.jsx`
- `src/components/wallet/SendCrypto.jsx`
- `src/components/wallet/ReceiveCrypto.jsx`

### 5. ‚úÖ Backend Authentication & Security
**Problem**: Authentication decorator and user context retrieval had issues.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced `require_auth` decorator in `backend/src/utils/security.py`
- Improved `get_current_user()` function with Auth0 token fallback
- Added better error handling for JWT token decoding
- Fixed user lookup by Auth0 ID and email

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/src/utils/security.py`
- `backend/src/routes/wallet_simple.py`

## üöÄ Additional Improvements Made

### 1. ‚úÖ Enhanced Environment Configuration
- Updated `.env.example` with Auth0 configuration
- Added comprehensive setup instructions
- Included demo mode settings for development

### 2. ‚úÖ Better Error Handling
